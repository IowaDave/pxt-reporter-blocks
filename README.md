### Create custom blocks in MakeCode from functions that return values

This repository accompanies an web-based article on [How To Create Functions That Return Values to Makecode](https://iowadave.github.io/pxt-reporter-blocks/).

The examples folder contains examples of code that the author has tested in a working MakeCode editor. Readers are welcome to copy the code and paste into their own MakeCode projects. See the article mentioned above for tips on how to write custom blocks.

### Catalog of the examples folder

#### Magic_8_Ball.ts
A custom block that returns a string selected from a set of 20 "answers" found in the classic Magic 8 Ball game popular during the mid-20th century. 

It works well in conjunction with the "on shake" block in MakeCode. Hold the micro:bit under your chin. Ask a question that can be answered yes or no. Then shake the micro:bit to reveal the mystery answer.
